    <h1>Mathemagician</h1>
    <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
    <p>A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician.</p>
    <p>
      {`
      The term &quot;mathemagic&quot; is believed to have been introduced by Royal
       Vale Heath with his 1933 book &quot;Mathemagic&quot;.
      `}

      {`
      The name &quot;mathemagician&quot; was probably first applied to Martin Gardner, 
      but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians, including 
      Arthur T. Benjamin, Persi Diaconis, and Colm Mulcahy. Diaconis has 
      suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is that &quot;inventing 
      a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very similar activities.&quot;

      {`
      Mathemagician is a neologism, specifically a portmanteau, that combines 
      mathematician and magician. A great number of self-working mentalism tricks 
      rely on mathematical principles. Max Maven often utilizes this type of magic in his performance.

      {`
      The Mathemagician is the name of a character in the 1961 children's 
      book The Phantom Tollbooth. He is the ruler of Digitopolis, the kingdom of mathematics.
