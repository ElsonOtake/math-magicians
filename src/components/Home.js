      <h1>Mathemagician</h1>
      <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
      <p>A mathemagician is a mathematician who is also a magician.</p>
      <p>The term "mathemagic" is believed to have been introduced by Royal
        Vale Heath with his 1933 book "Mathemagic".</p>
      <p>The name "mathemagician" was probably first applied to Martin Gardner, 
        but has since been used to describe many mathematician/magicians, including 
        Arthur T. Benjamin,[2] Persi Diaconis,[3] and Colm Mulcahy.[4] Diaconis has 
        suggested that the reason so many mathematicians are magicians is that "inventing 
        a magic trick and inventing a theorem are very similar activities."</p>
      <p>Mathemagician is a neologism, specifically a portmanteau, that combines 
        mathematician and magician. A great number of self-working mentalism tricks 
        rely on mathematical principles. Max Maven often utilizes this type of magic in his performance.</p>
      <p>The Mathemagician is the name of a character in the 1961 children's 
        book The Phantom Tollbooth. He is the ruler of Digitopolis, the kingdom of mathematics.</p>
